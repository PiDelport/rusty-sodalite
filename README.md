# Rusty Sodalite

Rusty Sodalite wraps the [Sodalite] Rust source port of [TweetNaCl] with a [Sodium]-style API.

[Sodalite]: https://crates.io/crates/sodalite
[TweetNaCl]: https://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/
[Sodium]: https://doc.libsodium.org/

## Features

âœ¨ **Small, pure Rust, `no_std`**

Like [Sodalite], Rusty Sodalite uses no C code or FFI bindings, and does not depend on `std`.
making it suitable for constrained and embedded targets.

âœ¨ **Interoperable with TweetNaCl**

Rusty Sodalite interoperates with [TweetNaCl], and ports such as [TweetNaCl.js].

[TweetNaCl.js]: https://tweetnacl.js.org/

âœ¨ **Ergonomic and safe**

Rusty Sodalite's provides an API that leverages Rust for safety and ease of use.
